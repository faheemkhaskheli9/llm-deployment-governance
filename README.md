# LLM Deployment Approval Platform

> LLM, RAG & Agentic AI portfolio project — independent open-source implementation.
> This is an original, from-scratch build. It is not affiliated with, and does not
> contain any code, prompts, data, or business logic from, any employer or client.

## 1. Problem

As prompts and models move toward production, teams need a governed pipeline with review, approval, audit trail, and rollback — similar to software release management but for LLM configurations.

## 2. Architecture

```text
Development -> Evaluation -> Review -> Approved -> Production (with audit + rollback at each stage)
```

## 3. Technology Stack

- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (task queue)
- React

## 4. Feature List

- Prompt version tracking
- Model version tracking
- Prompt diff viewer
- Model configuration diff viewer
- Evaluation results attached to each version
- Approval workflow (Dev -> Eval -> Review -> Approved -> Prod)
- Deployment history
- Rollback history
- Audit logs
- Environment promotion pipeline

## 5. Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Version and environment data model
2. Phase 2: Diff engine for prompts/configs
3. Phase 3: Approval workflow with role-based permissions
4. Phase 4: Audit log and rollback mechanics

## 6. Repository Structure

```

## 7. Setup

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd llm-deployment-governance
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # or: pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env              # fill in API keys / config
```

## 8. Dataset

Document which public dataset(s) or synthetic data generators are used here.
No proprietary, employer-owned, or client-identifiable data is used in this project.

## 9. Training / Execution

Document the commands used to run training, ingestion, or the main pipeline, e.g.:

```bash
python -m src.main --config configs/default.yaml
```

## 10. Evaluation

Document evaluation metrics and how to reproduce them here (see `docs/evaluation.md`).

## 11. Results

_To be filled in as the implementation progresses — screenshots, metrics tables, and
sample outputs go here._

## 12. API

_If this project exposes an API, document the main endpoints here (or link to
auto-generated OpenAPI docs, e.g. `/docs` for FastAPI)._

## 13. Docker

```bash
docker build -t llm-deployment-governance .
docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-deployment-governance
```

## 14. Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 15. Limitations

- This is a from-scratch, independent recreation built for portfolio purposes.
- Performance numbers, once added, are based on public datasets and are not
  representative of any production system's real-world results.

## 16. Future Work

- Expand evaluation coverage and add CI-based regression checks.
- Add more configuration presets and deployment targets.
- Track open items as GitHub Issues.

## 17. Disclosure

This repository is an **independent open-source recreation inspired by the kind of
production systems I have worked on professionally**. It contains no employer or
client source code, prompts, datasets, credentials, architecture diagrams, or
business logic. All code, data, and documentation here are original or built on
publicly available datasets and open-source tools.
